* Repository of my personal emacs configuration

  This repository is contains all the package I'm currently using in **Emacs**.

** Installation
   This step supposed that you have already installed a *vanilla emacs* on your PC.
   If you run the following command, the config will be imported.
   #+begin_src shell
     git clone https://github.com/NewMirai/dotemacs.git ~/.emacs.d
   #+end_src

*** LSP-DAP mode
   For ~lsp-mode~ and ~dap-mode~ please refer to their websites for installation
   instructions([[https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/][lsp-mode]],[[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/dap-mode][dap-mode]]).

*** Vterm
    To get ~Vterm~ working you need install it separately from *Emacs* (see
    [[https://github.com/akermu/emacs-libvterm][here]] for installation instructions).
